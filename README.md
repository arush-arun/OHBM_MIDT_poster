Interactive demonstration of the Monetary Incentive Delay Task (MIDT) used in fMRI research.

## About
This simulator shows exactly what participants experience during MIDT fMRI studies. It demonstrates the three-phase structure:
- **Phase 1:** Cue presentation (reward anticipation)
- **Phase 2:** Target response (quick reaction)
- **Phase 3:** Outcome feedback (reward processing)

## Usage
- **Easy Mode:** For demonstrations and learning
- **Realistic Mode:** Actual research conditions
- **Spacebar:** Respond to white squares

## Research Context
Used in the study: "Brain Reward Function in Young People with Cannabis Use Disorder: an fMRI Study"
- First fMRI study examining reward circuits in clinically diagnosed CUD
- Presented at OHBM 2025

- **Phase 1:** Cue presentation (reward anticipation)
- **Phase 2:** Target response (quick reaction)
- **Phase 3:** Outcome feedback (reward processing)

## Research Context
Used in the study: "Brain Reward Function in Young People with Cannabis Use Disorder: an fMRI Study"
- fMRI study examining reward circuits in clinically diagnosed CUD
- Presented at OHBM 2025
